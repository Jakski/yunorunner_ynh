If you want to enable Matrix notification, you should look at
the instructions inside `__FINAL_PATH__lib/chat_notify.sh` to deploy matrix-commander.

You may also want to tweak the `__FINAL_PATH__/config.py` file to run test with a different branch or architecture.

When you're ready to start the CI, restart its service via the webadmin or run `systemctl restart __APP__`.
