## Limitations

* You need to install [CI_package_check](https://github.com/YunoHost/CI_package_check) using the `install.sh` script before installing YunoRunner
* When YunoRunner is installed, modify the systemd script to add the path of the script `analyseCI.sh`. The default systemd is configured to `/home/CI_package_check/analyseCI.sh`
